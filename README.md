# Portfolio

After discovering a deep interest in the technological side of the information field I have challenged myself to learn the skills I need to work in data. I have completed the following projects to demonstrate what I have learned and to put these skills into pracice. Through them I have been able to develop practical skills which I'm sure will help me in my career.

## [Actual Price Calculator](https://github.com/bdchaput/Price-Calculator)

This is a simple app which calculates an item price with tax and tip included. I used this project to develop my abilities in GUI design and to put into practice my knowledge of Python. This project can be found here.

## [Vietnam Draft Lottery Data Analysis](https://github.com/bdchaput/Vietnam-Draft-Data)

In this project I put my love of the sixties and seventies to good use. I used python modules such as Seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and pandas to vizualize data on the Vietnam draft lottery. Using this data I examined the controversy that the draft was not completely random. Through this project I was able to experiment with the data vizualisaton tools Python has to offer.

## [Nursing Home Database](https://github.com/bdchaput/Nursing-Home-Database)

This is a project I completed in my last semester. In this assignment I had to create the model for a relational database that could be used by a nursing home. I extended this project further by including the code needed to build the database in SQL. This project provides an example of my knowledge of SQL as well as my understanding of the structure of relational databases.
